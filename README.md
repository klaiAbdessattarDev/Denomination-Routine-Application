## Description

An ATM has three cartridges for different denominations:
- 	10 EUR cartridge
- 	50 EUR cartridge
- 	100 EUR cartridge

Now we want to pay out following amounts from the ATM:
-	30 EUR
-	50 EUR
-	60 EUR
-	80 EUR
-	140 EUR
-	230 EUR
-	370 EUR
-	610 EUR
-	980 EUR
Write a program which will calculate for each payout the possible combinations which the ATM can pay out.
For example, for 100 EUR the available payout denominations would be:
-	10 x 10 EUR
-	1 x 50 EUR + 5 x 10 EUR
-	2 x 50 EUR
-	1 x 100 EUR
